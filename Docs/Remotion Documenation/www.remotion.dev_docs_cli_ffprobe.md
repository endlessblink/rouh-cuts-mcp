_available since v4.0_

In order to use `ffprobe` without having to directly install it, Remotion provides it via `npx remotion ffprobe`.

Note that in order to keep the binary size small, the FFprobe binary only understand the codecs that Remotion itself supports: H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9 and ProRes. A binary from the 7.1 release line of FFprobe is used.

```

bash

npx remotion ffprobe your_video.mp4
```
