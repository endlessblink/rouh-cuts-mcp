Ensures that `ffmpeg` or `ffprobe` are installed by downloading them from the internet if they cannot be found.

```

bash

npx remotion install ffmpeg
```

```

bash

npx remotion install ffprobe
```

You might not need to call this function. Remotion will automatically download `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` if a render is attempted, and no binary was found.

These commands are useful if you need `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` to be ready before the first render is started.
