We made a Chatbot that can answer simple questions about Remotion.

The Chatbot uses [CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app/) to index Remotion's documentation and make it queryable.

You can invoke it either by:

- Clicking on the "Ask AI" button anywhere on our docs
- Visiting [remotion.ai](https://remotion.ai/)
- Pressing `âŒ˜/Ctrl` \+ `I` while in the [Studio](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/studio)

For more complicated questions, you can ask human intelligence.

Join us on our [Discord](https://remotion.dev/discord) where you can get help.
