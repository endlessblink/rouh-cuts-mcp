Authoring a Remotion library works the same as authoring a normal React library. Usually, it is being published to GitHub and NPM.

## Starter template [​](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/authoring-packages\#starter-template "Direct link to Starter template")

[Remotion's library starter template](https://github.com/remotion-dev/library-starter/) is the recommended way to create a library or a component to be used with Remotion. It:

- correctly packages your library as ESM + CJS
- has an Remotion Studio instance built in for testing your library
- correctly defines Remotion as a peer dependency
- has TypeScript, ESLint and Turborepo configured

## Publishing [​](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/authoring-packages\#publishing "Direct link to Publishing")

You have three options to publish your library:

- **Publishing it for free to NPM**: The default for the starter template.
- **Sell it yourself via the NPM Kiosk**: See [NPM Kiosk](https://remotion.pro/npm-kiosk) for more info.
- **Apply to be listed in the [Remotion Store](https://www.remotion.pro/store)**: E-Mail [hi@remotion.dev](mailto:hi@remotion.dev) to pitch.
