note

üêß [Linux distros need at least version 2.35 of Libc.](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/issues/2439)

They also need to [install some additional packages](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/miscellaneous/linux-dependencies).

Alpine Linux and nixOS are unsupported.

- npm

Use npm as the package manager

Choose the template that is most suitable for you.

For your first project, we recommend the [Hello World](https://www.remotion.dev/templates/hello-world) template.

- Regular templates
- Next.js + React Router 7

After the project has been scaffolded, we recommend to open the project in your text editor and starting the [Remotion Studio](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/studio):

```

bash

npm run dev
```
