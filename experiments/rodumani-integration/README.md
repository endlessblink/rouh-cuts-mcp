# Rodumani MCP Server Integration

**Test the existing proven Remotion MCP server for professional video creation**

## What is Rodumani?

**GitHub**: `smilish67/rodumani`  
**Purpose**: Professional Remotion video editing through MCP protocol

## Capabilities

### Professional Video Editing
- **Media Management**: Upload video, audio, image files (MP4, MOV, AVI, MP3, WAV, JPG, PNG)
- **Timeline Editing**: Multi-track support with frame-level precision
- **Advanced Editing**: Trim, split, move clips, automatic overlap resolution, undo/redo
- **2D Transformations**: Position, scale, rotation, opacity adjustments
- **Keyframe Animation**: Time-based property changes with professional easing
- **Transition Effects**: fadeIn, fadeOut, slide animations

### MCP Integration
- **Direct Claude Desktop compatibility**
- **Professional API endpoints** for all editing operations
- **Session management** for complex projects
- **Export functionality** for final video output

## Setup Plan

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Install Rodumani MCP server
git clone https://github.com/smilish67/rodumani
cd rodumani
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Claude Desktop Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rodumani": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/rodumani/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test Professional Video Creation
- Use Rodumani's media management APIs
- Create GitHub showcase with professional timeline editing
- Test keyframe animations for smooth transitions
- Export high-quality video output

## Expected Results

If Rodumani works as documented:
- ✅ **Professional video editing capabilities** through Claude Desktop
- ✅ **No CSS conversion issues** - works natively with Remotion
- ✅ **Frame-level precision** for smooth animations
- ✅ **Proven working system** instead of experimental approach

## Comparison Benefits

This lets us compare:
- **Broken AST conversion** (current rough-cut-mcp) 
- **Professional MCP solution** (Rodumani)
- **Quality difference** should be dramatic

Test this approach first as it's most likely to provide immediate professional results.
